#Instructions
The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row. You play on a three by three game board. The first player will start playing as 'X'. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either oppent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled. Player one goes first, and in the event that no one has three in a row, the stalemate ends up in a draw. If a player makes three in a row, he wins.
In order to fill the board, players must select the value corresponding to the square number.

To play the game, you must open the following page: https://repl.it/@RonaldTingchale/Microverse-Ruby-Tic-Tac-Toe

Press "run" button to start the game. The user interface is in the right side of the page. You must put your inputs there, and the board will be displayed there as well.
