# About Tic Tac Toe
The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row.
You play on a three by three game board. The first player will start playing as 'X' and player two plays as 'O'.
Players take turns placing X's and O's on the game board until either opponent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled.
Player one goes first, and in the event that no one has three in a row, the stalemate ends up in a draw.
If a player makes three in a row, he wins.

# How to Play
1. Go to: https://repl.it/@RonaldTingchale/Microverse-Ruby-Tic-Tac-Toe
2. Click "Run". The user interface is in the right side of the page. You must put your inputs there, and the board will be displayed there as well.
3. Type in player one's name when you see "Player one name:" and press ENTER.
4. Type in player two's name when you see "Player two name:" and press ENTER.
5. An empty Tic Tac Toe board will be printed with the message "<player one name>, choose a square value:".
6. Player 1 can choose a square to draw an "X" by typing a number between 1-9 and press ENTER.
    For example, "1" corresponds to the top left square; "5 corresponds to the center square"; and "9" corresponds to the bottom right square.
7. Both players will take turns drawing their X's and O's in empty squares until someone wins by making 3 in a row or there is a draw.
